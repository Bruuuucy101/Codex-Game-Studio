# Test Setup

This skill scaffolds the automated testing infrastructure for the project.
It detects the configured engine, generates the appropriate test runner
configuration, creates the standard directory layout, and wires up CI/CD
so tests run on every push.

Run this once during the Technical Setup phase, before any implementation
begins. A test framework installed at sprint start costs 30 minutes.
A test framework installed at sprint four costs 3 sprints.

**Output:** `tests/` directory structure + `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

---

## Phase 1: Detect Engine and Existing State

1. **Read engine config**:
   - Read `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` and extract the `Engine:` value.
   - If engine is not configured (`[TO BE CONFIGURED]`), stop:
     "Engine not configured. Run `/setup-engine` first, then re-run `/test-setup`."

2. **Check for existing test infrastructure**:
   - Glob `tests/` — does the directory exist?
   - Glob `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` — do subdirectories exist?
   - Glob `.github/workflows/` — does a CI workflow file exist?
   - Glob `tests/gdunit4_runner.gd` (Godot) or `tests/EditMode/` (Unity) or
     `Source/Tests/` (Unreal) for engine-specific artifacts.
   - For Phaser 3/Three.js, inspect package.json scripts, package-lock.json,
     vitest.config.*, playwright.config.* and tests/web-unit/ + tests/browser/.
     Reuse the accepted game scaffold's tests; templates/node_modules do not mean
     the adopted game is configured. Read `.claude/docs/web-game-development.md`.

   - For libGDX inspect core/src/test and headless/src/test, Gradle settings/module
     files, wrapper/checksum and locks; read `.claude/docs/libgdx-development.md`.
     The existing Java starter tests take precedence over creating parallel test
     directories. Kotlin requires its actual configured test sourceSets/plugin.


3. **Report findings**:
   - "Engine: [engine]. Test directory: [found / not found]. CI workflow: [found / not found]."
   - If everything already exists AND `force` argument was not passed:
     "Test infrastructure appears to be in place. Re-run with `/test-setup force`
     to regenerate. Proceeding will not overwrite existing test files."

If the `force` argument is passed, skip the "already exists" early-exit and
proceed — but still do not overwrite files that already exist at a given path.
Only create files that are missing.

---

### libGDX Test Plan and Execution

Plan pure JUnit tests under core/src/test/java and actual backend tests under
headless/src/test/java (or existing configured Kotlin sourceSets). Pin the tested
Java starter's Jupiter 5.13.4 and launcher 1.13.4 under Gradle 8.14.3/JDK21;
existing project pins prevail. Use the shipped wrapper and locks, not global
Gradle or a moving latest dependency. Capture actual versions and outputs.

Acceptance: `./gradlew :core:test :headless:test :lwjgl3:installDist --no-daemon`.
Windows: `gradlew.bat` with the same tasks. Add no-watch-fs only if the host needs
it. Headless must instantiate gdx-backend-headless HeadlessApplication and verify
real create/render/pause/dispose, simulation collection/reset, bounded errors,
shutdown and Gdx state isolation; a pure unit is insufficient. Reuse the included
harness; never initialize SpriteBatch/GL in mock graphics. Keep backend tests
serialized. Desktop packaging is separate from a real GPU/input playtest.

For CI, add a JDK21 job, wrapper validation and clean copied/locked starter
acceptance alongside the existing engine/game jobs. Do not certify Android/iOS/GWT,
KTX/Ashley/Box2D without their separately configured dependencies/toolchains/tests.
Existing approval and no-overwrite rules still apply to the concrete plan below.


## Phase 2: Present Plan

Based on the engine detected and the existing state, present a plan:

```
## Test Setup Plan — [Engine]

I will create the following (skipping any that already exist):

tests/
  unit/           — Isolated unit tests for formulas, state, and logic
  integration/    — Cross-system tests and save/load round-trips
  smoke/          — Critical path test list (15-minute manual gate)
  evidence/       — Screenshot and manual test sign-off records
  README.md       — Test framework documentation

[Engine-specific files — see per-engine details below]

.github/workflows/tests.yml  — CI: run tests on every push to main

Estimated time: ~5 minutes to create all files.
```

Ask: "May I create these files? I will not overwrite any test files that
already exist at these paths."

Do not proceed without approval.

---

## Phase 3: Create Directory Structure

After approval, create the following files:

### `tests/README.md`

```markdown
# Test Infrastructure

**Engine**: [engine name + version]
**Test Framework**: [GdUnit4 | Unity Test Framework | UE Automation | Vitest + Playwright]
**CI**: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
**Setup date**: [date]

## Directory Layout

```
tests/
  unit/           # Isolated unit tests (formulas, state machines, logic)
  integration/    # Cross-system and save/load tests
  smoke/          # Critical path test list for /smoke-check gate
  evidence/       # Screenshot logs and manual test sign-off records
```

## Running Tests

[Engine-specific command — see below]

## Test Naming

- **Files**: `[system]_[feature]_test.[ext]`
- **Functions**: `test_[scenario]_[expected]`
- **Example**: `combat_damage_test.gd` → `test_base_attack_returns_expected_damage()`

## Story Type → Test Evidence

| Story Type | Required Evidence | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Logic | Automated unit test — must pass | `tests/unit/[system]/` |
| Integration | Integration test OR playtest doc | `tests/integration/[system]/` |
| Visual/Feel | Screenshot + lead sign-off | `tests/evidence/` |
| UI | Manual walkthrough OR interaction test | `tests/evidence/` |
| Config/Data | Smoke check pass | `production/qa/smoke-*.md` |

## CI

Tests run automatically on every push to `main` and on every pull request.
A failed test suite blocks merging.
```
```

### Engine-specific files

#### Godot 4 (`Engine: Godot`)

Create `tests/gdunit4_runner.gd`:

```gdscript
# GdUnit4 test runner — invoked by CI and /smoke-check
# Usage: godot --headless --script tests/gdunit4_runner.gd
extends SceneTree

func _init() -> void:
    var runner := load("res://addons/gdunit4/GdUnitRunner.gd")
    if runner == null:
        push_error("GdUnit4 not found. Install via AssetLib or addons/.")
        quit(1)
        return
    var instance = runner.new()
    instance.run_tests()
    quit(0)
```

Create `tests/unit/.gdignore_placeholder` with content:
`# Unit tests go here — one subdirectory per system (e.g., tests/unit/combat/)`

Create `tests/integration/.gdignore_placeholder` with content:
`# Integration tests go here — one subdirectory per system`

Note in the README: **Installing GdUnit4**
```
1. Open Godot → AssetLib → search "GdUnit4" → Download & Install
2. Enable the plugin: Project → Project Settings → Plugins → GdUnit4 ✓
3. Restart the editor
4. Verify: res://addons/gdunit4/ exists
```

#### Unity (`Engine: Unity`)

Create `tests/EditMode/` placeholder file `tests/EditMode/README.md`:
```markdown
# Edit Mode Tests
Unit tests that run without entering Play Mode.
Use for pure logic: formulas, state machines, data validation.
Assembly definition required: `tests/EditMode/EditModeTests.asmdef`
```

Create `tests/PlayMode/README.md`:
```markdown
# Play Mode Tests
Integration tests that run in a real game scene.
Use for cross-system interactions, physics, and coroutines.
Assembly definition required: `tests/PlayMode/PlayModeTests.asmdef`
```

Note in the README: **Enabling Unity Test Framework**
```
Window → General → Test Runner
(Unity Test Framework is included by default in Unity 2019+)
```

#### Unreal Engine (`Engine: Unreal` or `Engine: UE5`)

Create `Source/Tests/README.md`:
```markdown
# Unreal Automation Tests
Tests use the UE Automation Testing Framework.
Run via: Session Frontend → Automation → select "MyGame." tests
Or headlessly: UnrealEditor -nullrhi -ExecCmds="Automation RunTests MyGame.; Quit"

Test class naming: F[SystemName]Test
Test category naming: "MyGame.[System].[Feature]"
```

---

#### Phaser 3 / Three.js

Use the installed project's approved exact pins. New staged scaffolds use Vitest
4.1.11, Playwright 1.58.2, TypeScript 5.9.3 and Vite 7.3.6 with Node 22.14.0.
No unpinned `npm install` or `npx ...@latest`. Phaser has bundled declarations;
Three.js 0.186.0 uses @types/three 0.186.0 and same-package addons.

Create only missing configuration and tests. Propose merges to existing package
scripts/config/workflows; do not overwrite them even with `force`. Keep unit
include globs `tests/web-unit/**/*_test.ts` and Playwright testDir
`tests/browser/`. Use `test`, `typecheck`, `build`, `test:browser`,
`preview` scripts from the accepted scaffold, or record actual existing equivalents.
At least one pure state test must assert observable behavior, not just import a
module. Browser tests exercise real engine/input/rendering, not Vitest mocks.
A Playwright webServer should own a production preview and use
reuseExistingServer false in CI so unrelated servers cannot satisfy readiness.

## Phase 4: Create CI/CD Workflow

### Godot 4

Create `.github/workflows/tests.yml`:

```yaml
name: Automated Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run GdUnit4 Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          lfs: true

      - name: Run GdUnit4 Tests
        uses: MikeSchulze/gdUnit4-action@v1
        with:
          godot-version: '[VERSION FROM docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md]'
          paths: |
            tests/unit
            tests/integration
          report-name: test-results

      - name: Upload Test Results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: reports/
```

### Unity

Create `.github/workflows/tests.yml`:

```yaml
name: Automated Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Unity Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          lfs: true

      - name: Run Edit Mode Tests
        uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v4
        env:
          UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
        with:
          testMode: editmode
          artifactsPath: test-results/editmode

      - name: Run Play Mode Tests
        uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v4
        env:
          UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
        with:
          testMode: playmode
          artifactsPath: test-results/playmode

      - name: Upload Test Results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: test-results/
```

Note: Unity CI requires a `UNITY_LICENSE` secret. Add to GitHub repository
secrets before the first CI run.

### Unreal Engine

Create `.github/workflows/tests.yml`:

```yaml
name: Automated Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run UE Automation Tests
    runs-on: self-hosted  # UE requires a local runner with the editor installed

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          lfs: true

      - name: Run Automation Tests
        run: |
          "$UE_EDITOR_PATH" "${{ github.workspace }}/[ProjectName].uproject" \
            -nullrhi -nosound \
            -ExecCmds="Automation RunTests MyGame.; Quit" \
            -log -unattended
        shell: bash

      - name: Upload Logs
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: test-logs
          path: Saved/Logs/
```

Note: UE CI requires a self-hosted runner with Unreal Editor installed.
Set the `UE_EDITOR_PATH` environment variable on the runner.

---

### Phaser 3 / Three.js

Merge a web job after reviewing the existing workflow. In the game root with
Node 22.14.0 run, as separate failure-reporting steps:
```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm exec --no -- playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run test:browser
```
Dependency/browser installation is explicit setup work, never a side effect of
the scaffold helper or smoke check. Use the lockfile and installed Playwright
version. Preserve logs/screenshots on failure, and block release on this job.
Chromium alone does not certify Safari, mobile devices or WebGPU. Runnable
scaffolds are included; browser execution and screenshot acceptance remain
separate release gates. Consult `docs/codex-adapter/validation.md` for observed evidence.

## Phase 5: Create Smoke Test Seed

Create `tests/smoke/critical-paths.md`:

```markdown
# Smoke Test: Critical Paths

**Purpose**: Run these 10-15 checks in under 15 minutes before any QA hand-off.
**Run via**: `/smoke-check` (which reads this file)
**Update**: Add new entries when new core systems are implemented.

## Core Stability (always run)

1. Game launches to main menu without crash
2. New game / session can be started from the main menu
3. Main menu responds to all inputs without freezing

## Core Mechanic (update per sprint)

<!-- Add the primary mechanic for each sprint here as it is implemented -->
<!-- Example: "Player can move, jump, and the camera follows correctly" -->
4. [Primary mechanic — update when first core system is implemented]

## Data Integrity

5. Save game completes without error (once save system is implemented)
6. Load game restores correct state (once load system is implemented)

## Performance

7. No visible frame rate drops on target hardware (60fps target)
8. No memory growth over 5 minutes of play (once core loop is implemented)
```

---

## Phase 6: Post-Setup Summary

After writing all files, report:

```
Test infrastructure created for [engine].

Files created:
- tests/README.md
- tests/unit/ (directory)
- tests/integration/ (directory)
- tests/smoke/critical-paths.md
- tests/evidence/ (directory)
[engine-specific files]
- .github/workflows/tests.yml

Next steps:
1. [Engine-specific install step, e.g., "Install GdUnit4 via AssetLib"]
2. Write your first test: create tests/unit/[first-system]/[system]_test.[ext]
3. Run `/qa-plan sprint` before your first sprint to classify stories and set
   test evidence requirements
4. `/smoke-check` before every QA hand-off

Gate note: /gate-check Technical Setup → Pre-Production now requires:
- tests/ directory with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- .github/workflows/tests.yml
- At least one example test file
Run /test-setup and write one example test before advancing.

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — test framework scaffolded and CI/CD wired up.
```

---

## Collaborative Protocol

- **Never overwrite existing test files** — only create files that are missing.
  If a test runner file exists, leave it as-is.
- **Always ask before creating files** — Phase 2 requires explicit approval.
- **Engine detection is non-negotiable** — if the engine is not configured,
  stop and redirect to `/setup-engine`. Do not guess.
- **`force` flag skips the "already exists" early-exit but never overwrites.**
  It means "create any missing files even if the directory already exists."
- For Unity CI, note that the `UNITY_LICENSE` secret must be configured
  manually. Do not attempt to automate license management.
