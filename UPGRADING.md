# Upgrading Claude Code Game Studios

This guide covers upgrading your existing game project repo from one version
of the template to the next.

**Safety rule for every version section below:** historical labels such as
“Safe to Overwrite” and “no user content” apply only after comparing each local
path with the **exact adopted baseline**. Directory names do not prove a file is
unmodified. Customized paths always require a reviewed merge, including skills,
agents, hooks and other `.claude` infrastructure. Never replace a customized
`.claude` directory wholesale. New paths may also collide with your own files;
review deletions and renames for local content before applying them.

Identify your adopted template commit/tag from your adoption record, Git history
or saved original archive. A README version badge is a clue, not proof of exact
file ancestry. If the baseline is unknown, stop automated import and use the
manual comparison strategy below.

For **Codex Game Studio**, distinguish updating the adapter from importing
upstream source changes. Read [source maintenance](docs/codex-adapter/source-maintenance.md)
first: preserve the original lock, reviewed patch ledger and local adapters.

---

## Codex v0.1.1-beta → v0.2.0-beta

Retain the exact adopted baseline and merge customized files using the strategy
below. The current edition adds setup-tool and eight roles (Phaser, Three.js,
pipeline developer and five libGDX specialists), preserving all original identities.
Review the source patch ledger, regenerate adapters after authorized canonical
changes, then run strict checks and adapter tests. Do not replace project engine
pins, preferences, game content or review mode with template defaults.

The adapter still requires only Python 3.10+, Git and Bash. Optional web starters
need Node >=22.12.0/npm (CI 22.14.0); the optional libGDX starter needs JDK 21 and
ships a checksum-pinned Gradle 8.14.3 wrapper plus strict locks. Preview the scaffold
into a separate directory, add `--write` only for the selected copy, then explicitly
install/build/test in that target. Existing files are not overwritten. No board-sync
or provider dependency is added. Third-party packages and the official wrapper
retain their own licenses; see [notices](templates/libgdx/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

Read the [English quickstart](.github/README.md) or [Chinese quickstart](README-CODEX.zh-CN.md)
for commands, and [current validation](docs/codex-adapter/feature-validation-2026-09-21.md)
for tested platforms and boundaries. The upstream version sections below use
upstream's version numbering, separate from these Codex beta tags.

## Upgrade Strategies

Choose the path matching your history. First save a backup of tracked changes
and untracked/ignored game assets outside the checkout. Inspect `git status
--short`; deliberately commit or stash only the intended local work. Do not
continue with uncommitted changes, and do not assume a Git branch backs up
untracked assets. Keep the original checkout available during validation.

### Strategy A — Ordinary shared-history branch update

Use this only when updating the same repository/adapter branch and you want its
whole reviewed change set. Fetch the configured remote, inspect its URL and
choose a verified target commit. Check that histories actually share an ancestor:

```bash
git remote -v
git fetch origin
# Replace this value with the reviewed commit from your own configured remote.
update_target=REVIEWED_TARGET_COMMIT
git merge-base HEAD "$update_target"
git log --oneline HEAD.."$update_target"
git diff --stat HEAD "$update_target"
git branch backup/before-studio-update
git worktree add -b review/studio-update ../studio-update-review HEAD
cd ../studio-update-review
git merge --ff-only "$update_target"
```

Stop if there is no common ancestor. If `--ff-only` refuses because your branch
has diverged, inspect both sides and, only when the whole merge is intended,
use `git merge --no-commit --no-ff "$update_target"` in the review worktree.
Resolve conflicts using the local and incoming changes, then test before
committing. Use `git merge --abort` to abandon a conflicted/in-progress merge.
A fast-forward is already a commit update: validate before promoting the review
branch. Do not use an unrelated-history override for a template import.

### Strategy B — Selective baseline-aware template import

Use this for selected upstream fixes, including projects created from a ZIP or
GitHub template with unrelated histories. This creates a patch from the exact
adopted upstream baseline to a reviewed upstream target; it does not merge the
upstream repository into your game history.

After the clean-worktree/backup preparation above, use a new branch/worktree
name if the example names already exist. Check an existing `template` remote's
URL instead of replacing it; add it only if absent:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote add template https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios.git
git fetch template
# Choose immutable commits after reviewing the release/source changes.
template_base=EXACT_ADOPTED_BASELINE_COMMIT
template_target=REVIEWED_UPSTREAM_TARGET_COMMIT
git rev-parse --verify "$template_base^{commit}"
git rev-parse --verify "$template_target^{commit}"
git diff --name-status "$template_base" "$template_target"
git branch backup/before-template-import
git worktree add -b review/template-import ../template-import-review HEAD
cd ../template-import-review

# Example allowlist: review dependencies before choosing the actual paths.
git diff "$template_base" HEAD -- .claude/skills/sprint-plan/SKILL.md
git diff "$template_base" "$template_target" -- .claude/skills/sprint-plan/SKILL.md
update_patch=$(mktemp)
git diff --binary --full-index "$template_base" "$template_target" -- .claude/skills/sprint-plan/SKILL.md > "$update_patch"
git apply --check "$update_patch"
# Run this only when the check succeeds and the diff is approved:
git apply "$update_patch"
git diff --check
git diff -- .claude/skills/sprint-plan/SKILL.md
```

The baseline-to-HEAD diff reveals local customizations, even without shared
history. Inspect the complete patch, dependencies, renames and deletions before
applying; a clean application can still be semantically wrong. Keep adapter
wrappers, `.codex` configuration, project instructions and game content outside
the source import allowlist. Never run an upstream checkout/copy over all files.

If `git apply --check` fails, it has changed nothing: **stop that sequence**.
With the original upstream blobs available from the fetch, try
`git apply --3way "$update_patch"` only in the clean review worktree. This updates
the index as well as files and may leave conflicts; it does not guarantee a safe
merge. Inspect `git status --short`, `git ls-files -u`, and each conflict. Preserve
local requirements and integrate the reviewed upstream correction, remove
conflict markers, then `git add` only the resolved allowlisted paths. Inspect
both `git diff` and `git diff --cached` and run the project checks. If base blobs
are unavailable or the baseline cannot be verified, use manual comparison.

To abandon an apply attempt, keep the original checkout untouched. In the
initially clean disposable review worktree, restore only the attempted tracked
paths from its pre-import `HEAD`, for example:

```bash
git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree -- .claude/skills/sprint-plan/SKILL.md
```

Review and remove only new files created by that attempt if any; do not run a
blanket clean/reset. Unlike `git merge`, `git apply` has no `--abort` command.

Once checks pass, commit the selected source changes with the baseline/target
IDs and test evidence. For Codex source changes, also review the patch ledger
and regenerate adapters as described in source maintenance. Inspect and test
those generated changes separately before committing. Promote the reviewed
commit into your clean original branch with a fast-forward if possible; if
that branch changed meanwhile, re-review its integration. Keep the backup until
the game and adapter checks pass. Delete the temporary patch when finished.

A cherry-pick is another option only after reviewing the exact commit and all
of its paths/dependencies. Use a disposable review worktree; on conflict,
resolve and test before `git cherry-pick --continue`, or abandon with
`git cherry-pick --abort`. Do not cherry-pick broad template reorganizations
merely to obtain one workflow fix.

### Strategy C — Manual three-version comparison

For archives or an unknown baseline, obtain the original adopted snapshot if
possible and compare **original**, **your customized file**, and **new file**
side by side. Apply only understood changes in a backed-up copy or review
worktree. If the original cannot be recovered, use a careful two-file review
and record that provenance gap; do not assert the local file is pristine.
Only replace an individual file after proving it matches the exact adopted
baseline and reviewing its incoming changes. Preserve local engine settings,
prompts, hooks and adapters, and test before promoting the update.

### Files: Merge Carefully

No baseline project-content changes are listed; any locally customized infrastructure still requires a reviewed merge.

---

### New Features

#### Director Gates System

All major workflow skills now reference named gate checkpoints defined in
`.claude/docs/director-gates.md`. Gates are identified by domain prefix and name
(e.g., `CD-CONCEPT`, `TD-ARCHITECTURE`, `LP-CODE-REVIEW`). Each gate defines
which director to spawn, what inputs to pass, what verdicts mean, and how
lean/solo modes affect it.

Skills spawn gates using `Task` with the gate ID and documented inputs, rather
than embedding director prompts inline. This keeps skill bodies clean and makes
gate behavior consistent across all workflow phases.

#### Gate Intensity Modes

Three modes let you control how much director review you get:

- **`full`** (default) — all director gates run at every review checkpoint
- **`lean`** — per-skill director reviews are skipped; phase gates at `/gate-check` still run
- **`solo`** — no director gates anywhere; `/gate-check` checks artifact existence only

Set globally during `/start` (writes `production/review-mode.txt`). Override any
individual run with `--review [mode]` on any gate-using skill:

```
/design-system combat --review lean
/gate-check concept --review full
/brainstorm my-game-idea --review solo
```

---

### After Upgrading

1. Run `/start` once to set your preferred review mode — or create `production/review-mode.txt` manually with `full`, `lean`, or `solo`.
2. If you're mid-project, review `.claude/docs/director-gates.md` to understand which gates apply to your current phase.
3. Run `/skill-test static all` to verify all skills pass structural checks.

### Files: Merge Carefully

#### `.claude/settings.json`

Four new hooks are registered in this version. If you haven't customized `settings.json`, overwriting is safe. Otherwise, add the following hook entries manually:

- `log-agent-stop.sh` — `SubagentStop` event (agent audit trail stop)
- `notify.sh` — `Notification` event (Windows toast notification)
- `post-compact.sh` — `PostCompact` event (session recovery reminder)
- `validate-skill-change.sh` — `PostToolUse` event filtered to `.claude/skills/` writes

#### Customized agent files

If you've added project-specific knowledge to agent `.md` files, do a diff and manually add the `memory: project` line to the YAML frontmatter where appropriate. Creative and technical director agents intentionally keep `memory: user` — only specialist agents get `memory: project`.

---

### New Features

#### Complete Story Lifecycle

Stories now have a formal lifecycle enforced by two skills:

- **`/story-readiness`** — validates a story is implementation-ready before a developer picks it up. Checks Design (GDD req linked), Architecture (ADR accepted), Scope (criteria testable), and DoD (manifest version current). Verdict: READY / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED.
- **`/story-done`** — 8-phase completion review after implementation. Verifies each acceptance criterion, checks for GDD/ADR deviations, prompts code review, updates the story file to `Status: Complete`, and surfaces the next ready story.

Flow: `/story-readiness` → implement → `/story-done` → next story

#### Full UX/UI Pipeline

- **`/ux-design`** — guided section-by-section UX spec authoring. Three modes: screen/flow, HUD, or interaction pattern library. Reads GDD UI requirements and player journey. Output to `design/ux/`.
- **`/ux-review`** — validates UX specs against GDD alignment, accessibility tier, and pattern library. Verdict: APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION / MAJOR REVISION.
- **`/team-ui`** updated: Phase 1 now runs `/ux-design` + `/ux-review` as a hard gate before visual design begins.

#### Brownfield Adoption

**`/adopt`** onboards existing projects to the template format. Audits internal structure of GDDs, ADRs, stories, systems-index, and infra. Classifies gaps (BLOCKING/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). Builds an ordered migration plan. Never regenerates existing artifacts — only fills gaps.

Argument modes: `full | gdds | adrs | stories | infra`

Also: `/design-system retrofit [path]` and `/architecture-decision retrofit [path]` detect existing files and add only missing sections.

#### Sprint Tracking YAML

`production/sprint-status.yaml` is now the authoritative story tracking format:
- Written by `/sprint-plan` (initializes all stories) and `/story-done` (sets status to `done`)
- Read by `/sprint-status` (fast snapshot) and `/help` (per-story status in production phase)
- Status values: `backlog | ready-for-dev | in-progress | review | done | blocked`
- Falls back gracefully to markdown scanning if file doesn't exist

#### `/help` — Context-Aware Next Step

`/help` reads your current stage and in-progress work, checks which artifacts are complete, and tells you exactly what to do next — one primary required step, plus optional opportunities. Distinct from `/start` (first-time only) and `/project-stage-detect` (full audit).

#### Comprehensive QA and Testing Framework

Nine new QA/testing skills covering the full testing lifecycle:

- **`/test-setup`** — scaffolds the test framework and CI/CD pipeline for your engine
- **`/test-helpers`** — generates engine-specific test helper libraries (GDUnit4, NUnit, etc.)
- **`/qa-plan`** — generates a QA test plan for a sprint or feature, classifying stories by test type
- **`/smoke-check`** — runs the critical path smoke test gate before QA hand-off
- **`/soak-test`** — generates a soak test protocol for extended play sessions (stability, memory leaks)
- **`/regression-suite`** — maps test coverage to GDD critical paths, identifies fixed bugs lacking regression tests
- **`/test-evidence-review`** — quality review of test files and manual evidence documents
- **`/test-flakiness`** — detects non-deterministic tests by reading CI run logs
- **`/skill-test`** — validates skill files for structural compliance and behavioral correctness (three modes: lint, spec, catalog)

Also new: **`/bug-triage`** re-evaluates all open bugs for priority, severity, and ownership.

#### Skill Validator (`/skill-test`)

`/skill-test` is a meta-skill for validating the harness itself. Run it after editing any skill file. Three modes:
- `lint` — validates YAML frontmatter and required fields
- `spec [skill-name]` — runs behavioral spec tests against a specific skill
- `catalog` — checks that all skills in `.claude/skills/` are indexed in the catalog

The new `validate-skill-change.sh` hook reminds you to run `/skill-test` automatically when a skill file is modified.

#### Team Live-Ops and Team QA Orchestration

- **`/team-live-ops`** — coordinates live-ops-designer + economy-designer + community-manager + analytics-engineer for post-launch content planning (seasonal events, battle pass, retention)
- **`/team-qa`** — orchestrates qa-lead + qa-tester + gameplay-programmer + producer through a full QA cycle: strategy, execution, coverage, and sign-off

#### Model Tier Routing

Skills are now explicitly assigned to Haiku, Sonnet, or Opus tiers based on task complexity. Read-only status checks use Haiku; complex multi-document synthesis uses Opus; everything else defaults to Sonnet. Tier assignments are documented in `.claude/docs/coordination-rules.md`.

#### Directory CLAUDE.md Files

Three new directory-scoped CLAUDE.md files (`design/`, `src/`, `docs/`) provide path-specific instructions to agents working in those directories. These load automatically when Claude Code reads files in that directory.

---

### After Upgrading

1. **Verify new hooks** are registered in `.claude/settings.json` — check for all four: `log-agent-stop.sh`, `notify.sh`, `post-compact.sh`, `validate-skill-change.sh`.

2. **Test the audit trail** by spawning any subagent — both start and stop events should appear in `production/session-logs/`.

3. **Generate sprint-status.yaml** if you're in active production:
   ```
   /sprint-plan status
   ```

4. **Run `/adopt`** if you have existing GDDs or ADRs that predate this template version — it will identify which sections need to be added without overwriting your content.

5. **Validate your skills** after any skill edits with `/skill-test` — the new `validate-skill-change.sh` hook will automatically remind you to do this.

## v0.2.0 → v0.3.0

**Released:** 2026-03-09
**Commit range:** `e289ce9..HEAD`
**Key themes:** `/design-system` GDD authoring, `/map-systems` rename, custom status line

### Breaking Changes

#### `/design-systems` renamed to `/map-systems`

The `/design-systems` skill was renamed to `/map-systems` for clarity
(decomposing = *mapping*, not *designing*).

**Action required:** Update any documentation, notes, or scripts that invoke
`/design-systems`. The new invocation is `/map-systems`.

### What Changed

| Category | Changes |
|----------|---------|
| **New skills** | `/design-system` (guided GDD authoring, section-by-section) |
| **Renamed skills** | `/design-systems` → `/map-systems` (breaking rename) |
| **New files** | `.claude/statusline.sh`, `.claude/settings.json` statusline config |
| **Skill updates** | `/gate-check` — writes `production/stage.txt` on PASS, new phase definitions |
| **Skill updates** | `brainstorm`, `start`, `design-review`, `project-stage-detect`, `setup-engine` — cross-reference fixes |
| **Bug fixes** | `log-agent.sh`, `validate-commit.sh` — hook execution fixed |
| **Docs** | `UPGRADING.md` added, `README.md` updated, `WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` updated |

### Files: Safe to Overwrite

**New files to add:**
```
.claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md
.claude/statusline.sh
```

**Existing files to overwrite (no user content):**
```
.claude/skills/map-systems/SKILL.md      ← was design-systems/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/gate-check/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/start/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/design-review/SKILL.md

docs/WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md
UPGRADING.md
```

**Delete (replaced by rename):**
```
.claude/skills/design-systems/   ← entire directory; replaced by map-systems/
```

---

### Files: Merge Carefully

#### `.claude/settings.json`

The new version adds a `statusLine` configuration block pointing to
`.claude/statusline.sh`. If you haven't customized `settings.json`, overwriting
is safe. Otherwise, add this block manually:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "script": ".claude/statusline.sh"
}
```

---

### New Features

#### Custom Status Line

`.claude/statusline.sh` displays a 7-stage production pipeline breadcrumb in
the terminal status line:

```
ctx: 42% | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Systems Design
```

In Production/Polish/Release stages, it also shows the active Epic/Feature/Task
from `production/session-state/active.md` if a `<!-- STATUS -->` block is present:

```
ctx: 42% | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Production | Combat System > Melee Combat > Hitboxes
```

The current stage is auto-detected from project artifacts, or can be pinned by
writing a stage name to `production/stage.txt`.

#### `/gate-check` Stage Advancement

When a gate PASS verdict is confirmed, `/gate-check` now writes the new stage
name to `production/stage.txt`. This immediately updates the status line for all
future sessions without requiring manual file edits.

---

### After Upgrading

1. **Review the renamed skill:** compare the old directory with its adopted
   baseline, migrate custom instructions to `map-systems/`, and only then remove
   the obsolete tracked files in the review worktree.

2. **Test the status line** by starting a Claude Code session — you should see
   the stage breadcrumb in the terminal footer.

3. **Verify hook execution** still works:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/hooks/log-agent.sh '{}' '{}'
   bash .claude/hooks/validate-commit.sh '{}' '{}'
   ```

---

### Files: Merge Carefully

These files contain both template structure and your project-specific content.
Do **not** overwrite them — merge the changes manually.

#### `CLAUDE.md`

The template version was slimmed from ~159 lines to ~60 lines. The key
structural change: 5 doc imports were removed because they're auto-loaded
by Claude Code anyway (agent-roster, skills-reference, hooks-reference,
rules-reference, review-workflow).

**What to keep from your version:**
- The `## Technology Stack` section (your engine/language choices)
- Any project-specific additions you made

**What to adopt from the new version:**
- Slimmer imports list (drop the 5 redundant `@` imports if present)
- Updated collaboration protocol wording

#### `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`

If you ran `/setup-engine`, this file has your engine config, naming
conventions, and performance budgets. Keep all of it. The template version
is just the empty placeholder.

#### `.claude/docs/templates/game-concept.md`

Minor structural update — a `## Next Steps` section was added pointing to
`/map-systems`. Add that section to your copy if you want the updated
guidance, but it's not required.

#### `.claude/settings.json`

Check whether the new version adds any permission rules you want. The change
was minor (schema update). If you haven't customized your `settings.json`,
overwriting is safe.

#### Customized agent files

If you've added project-specific knowledge or custom behavior to any agent
`.md` file, do a diff and manually add the new AskUserQuestion integration
sections rather than overwriting. The change in each agent is a standardized
collaborative protocol block at the end of the system prompt.

---

### Files: Delete

These files were removed in v0.2.0. Review their local changes and migrate any
custom content to the replacement before deleting an obsolete path.

```
docs/IMPROVEMENTS-PROPOSAL.md      → superseded by WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md
docs/MULTI-STAGE-DOCUMENT-WORKFLOW.md → content merged into context-management.md
```

---

### After Upgrading

1. **Run `/project-stage-detect`** to verify the system reads your project
   correctly with the new detection logic.

2. **Run `/start`** once if you haven't used it — it now correctly identifies
   your stage and skips onboarding steps you've already done.

3. **Check `production/session-state/`** exists and is gitignored:
   ```bash
   ls production/session-state/
   cat .gitignore | grep session-state
   ```

4. **Test hook execution** — if you're on Windows, verify the new hooks run
   without errors in Git Bash:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/hooks/detect-gaps.sh '{}' '{}'
   bash .claude/hooks/session-start.sh '{}' '{}'
   ```

---

*Each future version will have its own section in this file.*
